          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) strives to assist travelers, businesses, and the public in their concerns or questions regarding national security. Citizenship inquiries, and natural disaster & terrorist advisories are some of the main platforms of information provided on the DHS site.</p>
          <p>Although the the DHS website contains very pertinent information for citizens and non-citizens, it is extremely hard to navigate and find this information.</p>
          <p><strong>The goal of this project was to redesign the site to help users more easily access forms or information regarding national security related topics.</strong></p>
          <h3>User Persona</h3>
          <img src="Images/User Persona Image.png">
          <p>Based on a discussion with my partner, we decided that one of the most common uses for the DHS site would be to attain information or forms regarding US citizenship or forms for small business owners. From there, we began to construct a user persona. </p>
          <p>We decided our user persona would be a 29 year old Italian citizen named Mario DiRosa. Mario runs a clothing business in Florence, but would like to expand his business internationally. He would like to transfer his work to New York  and find out how to become a citizen.</p>
          <p>Therefore, he needs information on the process of moving to the United States, as well as how to legally work in the US.</p>
          <p>Since he is foreign, he doesn’t know much about the immigration process and is overwhelmed on where to begin. Since English is his second language, he worries complicated legal terms will be hard to understand.</p>
          <h3>User Flow</h3>
          <img src="Images/User Flow Image.png">
          <p>Based on our user persona, we went through what the current user flow would be. Through this quick heuristic evaluation, we realized that even as native English speakers, the categorization of the pages were very confusing.</p>
          <p>For instance, if I was looking to find more information on citizenship, I would be confused on whether to click “Apply for a U.S. Passport,” “Cross Borders,” and “Become a Citizen” even with the descriptions below those items.</p>
          <h3>User Testing</h3>
          <img src="Images/User Testing Image.png">
          <p>Once we established the user flow and the potential pain points from our heuristic evaluation, we turned to users to see if their pain points aligned with our own.</p>
          <p>We tested 5 non-government officials between the ages of 25 and 25 who were viewing the site for the first time. We gave them the prompt shown above and were told to complete the three tasks.</p>
          <h3>Research Analysis</h3>
          <img src="Images/Research Analysis Image.png">
          <p>In order to organize the data from the user tests, we used an affinity diagram and a feature prioritization matrix. From our analysis, we discovered the following main insights.</p>
          <p><strong>Users:</strong></p>
          <ul>
              <li>Felt that menu options were limited and vague</li>
              <li>Navigation bar titles were confusing (i.e. Topics vs. In Focus?)</li>
              <li>Suggested better categorization of sections</li>
              <li>Felt confused by technical or legal terminology</li>
              <li>Liked descriptions under services for the public</li>
              <li>Even after navigation, still were unsure of the specific role of and scope of DHS</li>
              <li>Too much on the home screen especially the articles linked below news which made it difficult to know which direction to go in</li>
              <li>Within each page of the site, the categories were also extremely overwhelming</li>
              <li>Social media links seemed unnecessary to be on the main screen</li>
            </ul> 
            <h3>Ideation & Brainstorming</h3>
            <img src="Images/Ideation Image.png">
            <p>Based off of the navigation pain points we attained from the user testing analysis, it seemed that categorization of subjects and confusing terminology made it hard for users to find pertinent information.</p>
            <p>In order to begin tackling these issues, we decided to start by card sorting the navigation elements and then creating a new site map to organize it better.</p>
