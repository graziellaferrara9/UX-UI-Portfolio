            You may be wondering, how does a girl in commerical real estate come to the realization that she belongs in the world of UX/UI research and design? Well, I’m glad you asked. </p>
        <p>My research journey began during my time at Fordham University where I attained my Bachelor’s in Psychology. I was always interested in the way people cognitively made decisions. </p>
        <p> Throughout that time, I worked as a data analyst for a research lab where I worked on administering an online computer game that we helped iterate that was rigged to fail. We administered this game to children with and without ADHD. Our observations led us to understand how children with ADHD varied from children without ADHD in how they regulated their emotions in the face of frustration. </p>
        <p> an experience set the tone for my passion toward UX/UI research. Of course, the path of life isn’t always linear, but in all my experiences since I  have held my curiosity for how users’ experience with products affects their behavior. </p>
        <p>It is extremely satisfying to be able to enhance the user experience based on such observations by iterating on designs. </p>
